Radar simulation uses, matplotlib, tkinter, random and numpy library. 

Current stage allows user to input values for the height and x and y coordinates of the vertices, where rays are generated and launched from a radar modelled as a point source, with the beam modelled as a number of discrete rays. Rays attempted to interact and bounce with the foward facing face of the prism, where if the rays reach an area around the point sourfce a hit is recorded.
